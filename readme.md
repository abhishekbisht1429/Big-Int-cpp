**Big Integer Implementation in C++**

- Multiplication is implemented using long multiplication (traditional pen and paper based algorithm)
-  Divsion is implemented using long Division (traditional pen and paper based algorithm)
- This implementaion does not rely on the standard template library or even String class in c++. It has been implemented using char arrays.
